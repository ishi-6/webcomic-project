wanted to make a webcomic viewing website different than the usual webtoon/literal comic (including text, pagination, slight panel transitions, sound when i want) <br>
run: cd act1, npm run dev <br>
didnt upload .env file to github (since it contains api keys) <br>
see it here, (with, currently, placeholder assets):
